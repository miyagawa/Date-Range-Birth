NAME
    Date::Range::Birth - range of birthday for an age

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Range::Birth;

      # birthday for those who are 24 years old now
      my $range = Date::Range::Birth->new(24);

      # birthday for those who are 24 years old in 2001-01-01
      my $date   = Date::Simple->new(2001, 1, 1);
      my $range2 = Date::Range::Birth->new(24, $date);

      # birthday for those who are between 20 and 30 yeard old now
      my $range3 = Date::Range::Birth->new([ 20, 30 ]);

DESCRIPTION
    Date::Range::Birth is a subclass of Date::Range, which provides a way to
    construct range of dates for birthday.

METHODS
    new $range = Date::Range::Birth->new($age); $range = Date::Range::Birth-
        >new($age, $date); $range = Date::Range::Birth->new([ $young, $old
        ]); $range = Date::Range::Birth->new([ $young, $old ], $date);

        returns Date::Range::Birth object for birthday of the age. If
        `$date' (Date::Simple object) provided, returns range of birthday
        for those who are `$age' years old in `$date'. Default is today
        (now).

        If the age is provided as array reference (like `[ $young, $old ]'),
        returns range of birthday for those who are between `$young' -
        `$old' years old.

    Other methods are inherited from Date::Range. See the Date::Range
    manpage for details.
